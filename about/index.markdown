This is a brief history or simple stories of my life since 2006.

I would like to keep a dairy or so called blog for a long time. The main purpose was to share something with my friends at first. However, most of the guys now stop updating their blogs and so do I. I can hardly write a new post for months due to the dull life recently.

The blog present here is a summary of all my former blogs (I was used to modifying a lot). As a result of my acknowledge about Git, I decide to do a summary work here and try to update more frequently.
